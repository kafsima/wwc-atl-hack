###Objective:
Demonstrate IoT proof-of-concept for low-cost remove sensing system for leak detection

###Audience:
Small- to mid-size fuel farms (<100 employees, <50M revenue), needing an out-of-the-box solution

###Technologies Used:
Arduino, Processing, Firebase (runs on JSON), Python ([Pyrebase](https://github.com/thisbejim/Pyrebase)), Bootstrap

###Schematic:
