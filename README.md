## Codename: Kafsima
Team Members: Danae, Hina, Lauren, Reese, Stephanie, Tisha, Tarenia


###Objective:
Demonstrate IoT proof-of-concept for low-cost remove sensing system for leak detection

###Audience:
Small- to mid-size fuel farms (<100 employees, <50M revenue), needing an out-of-the-box solution

###Technologies Used:
Arduino, Processing, Firebase (JSON), Python ([Pyrebase](https://github.com/thisbejim/Pyrebase)), Jupyter

###Schematic:

###Next steps:

- Development of UI/UX i.e. getting data out of Firebase and running it against user-set threshold levels
- Develop SMS alert system for real-time monitoring
- Wireless connection for multiple Arduino boards to talk to centralized server
- External power supply for Arduino (battery pack?)
- Add additional sensor functionality
- Mold plastic case for commercial product
